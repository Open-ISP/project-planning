# Select REZ resource limits from IASR work bookd

## Status
Under consideration

## Decision
To use resource limits, land used limits, or both?

## Context
The IASR files specifies resource limits twice and it is unclear which values to use.
The 'resource limits' are much smaller than the 'land use limit', and the 
'resource limits' also have an assocaited penalty factor.

## Options Considered

## Outcome
For now using 'resource limits' to build something out but this should be revisited and 
clarify.
