# Annuitized investment costs

## Status
Under consideration

## Decision
ISPyPSA used annuitized investment costs, how do we convert the capital cost provided
with the ISP inputs to annuitized costs?

## Context

So ISP methodology says they use the following formula for the cost benefit analysis:

(capital_cost * wacc) / (1 - (1 + wacc) ** asset_lifetime)

IASR specifies wacc and asset lifetimes for new generators but can't seem to find
asset lifetime for transmission projects.

## Options Considered
