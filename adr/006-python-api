# Python API design

## Status

Accepted

## Decision

Proposal to refactor the API such that each step in the workflow is run through a single
function (or one or two high level functions) .i.e templater run through
create_template(). These will be public functions that an ISPyPSA user can import, and
also used in the dodo file. Additionally, these functions will not handle disk io,
but just return a dict of dataframes, with disk io handled via dedicated io functions.

## Context

The objective of this change is to:

- Simplify the dodo file so it is easier to read.
- Make the core ISPyPSA functionality more accessible by allowing it to be used through
  a small number of functions.
- Make the core functionality easier to document via docstrings in core functions
- Make testing easier by having the core functionality use dataframes as io rather
  than writing to disk

## Options Considered

NA

## Consequences
